Working with class and objects.

understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) is essential for real world sofrtware development.
python supports classes and objects, which allow you to model real world entities.

Concepts 
    1. Class: - A blueprint for creating objects(instances)
    2. object: - An intance of class.
    3. Attributes: - Data stored in an object (variable)
    4. Constructor: - The __init__(): - method to initialize Attributes.


tasks ---- you know what you wants then do it.




Pillars of OOPs.
    1. Encpsulation: - Wrapping the data (Attributes) and methods into a single unit(class). it allow the hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only neccesary parts. 

    e.g. you can only interact with car engine through its start() method, not by directly accessing the engine.



    2. Inharitance: - creating a new class (child class) that inherits properties and method from an existing class (parent class)

    e.g. A Truck class can inherit from a Car class, but with additional Attributes like cargo_capacity.



    3. Polymorphism: - The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of same class through inheritance. it also allow methods to behave differently based on the object. //     n  1.verloading 2. overriding



    4. Abstarction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only necessary features.

    e.g You don't need to know the internal working of car engine in order to drive it. you just use start() method.
